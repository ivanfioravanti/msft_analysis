        <p className="text-lg">
          For long-term investors, Microsoft represents a high-quality core technology holding despite its premium valuation 
          and technical weakness. The company's diversified business model, financial strength, and exposure to secular 
          growth trends position it well for continued success over a 5+ year horizon. Near-term investors should consider 
          waiting for more favorable entry points or technical improvement.
